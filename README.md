# leafkin-sample-data-and-tutorial-script
This repository contains sample data and a tutorial script to get started with the leafkin package. Ideally, you download all files in a zipped folder and extract the files on your computer. If you **keep the structure of the extracted files** (i.e. sample data in the "data files" folder and the RStudio project, the tutorial R script and the data files folder in the main folder), the path to the sample data created with the tutorial script should work.
