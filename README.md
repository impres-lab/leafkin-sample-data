# leafkin-sample-data
This repository contains sample data and a tutorial script to get started with the leafkin package. Ideally, you download all files in a zipped folder and extract the files on your computer. If you keep the structure of the extracted files (i.e. sample data in the "data files" folder. RStudio project, tutorial R script and data files folder in the same folder), the path to the sample data created with the tutorial script should work.
