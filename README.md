# leafkin-sample-data-and-tutorial-script
This repository contains sample data and a tutorial script to get started with the leafkin package. Ideally, you download all files in a zipped folder and **extract the *folder* on your computer** (not extracting will result in an error). If you **keep the structure of the files in the extracted folder** (i.e. sample data in the "data files" folder and the RStudio project, the tutorial R script and the data files folder in the main folder), the path to the sample data created with the tutorial script should work.

**IMPORTANT:** Please consult the README.md file in the leafkin repository ([link](leafkin/README.md)) for help on errors or specific difficulties. Especially the first topic, on leafkin installation, can be useful.
